Basic starter kit for vue, typescript, vuetify. Uses parcel for bundling.

Open on codesandbox:

https://codesandbox.io/s/github/tm-3/vue-starter-codesandbox

If you are using codesandbox and you want to run storybook you will need to change the port in sandbox.config.json to 6006 and start the storybook task from the server control menu panel.
I have yet to get any add-ons for storybook to work with vue and typescript so if you are a kind person and you know the answer to this drop me a note.

Have not tested jest config yet.
